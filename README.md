# C++ Problem Solving

This repository is dedicated to technical interview preparation using C++.  
The file `problem_solving_practice.cpp` contains solutions to common coding interview problems, focusing on clear logic, optimal complexity, and interview-ready code.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Improve algorithmic and problem-solving skills
- Practice common coding interview patterns
- Write clean, readable, and explainable C++ code
- Prepare for technical interviews and coding assessments

---

## 📂 File Structure

problem_solving_practice.cpp  
Contains multiple interview-style problems implemented in C++.

---

## 📝 Solution Approach

Each problem is solved with an interview mindset:

- Start with a simple or brute-force idea
- Improve toward an optimized solution
- Handle edge cases explicitly
- Keep the code easy to explain during an interview
- Prioritize clarity over unnecessary optimizations

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or newer

Example:
g++ --version

---

## ▶️ Compile and Run

g++ problem_solving_practice.cpp -o interview_prep  
./interview_prep

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add problem difficulty labels (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- Reference problem sources (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.)
- Split problems into categorized files
- Add comments explaining time and space complexity
- Add unit tests
