# Embedded Linux Practice – C++ & Bash Scripting

This repository is dedicated to **practicing Embedded Linux development concepts** using **C++ and Bash scripting**.  
It focuses on building hands-on experience with Linux-based systems, system-level programming, and automation commonly used in embedded environments.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice Embedded Linux development fundamentals
- Develop system-level thinking using **C++**
- Use **Bash scripting** for automation and system interaction
- Understand how applications interact with the Linux operating system
- Write clean, maintainable, and practical code

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- C++ source files for system-level and problem-solving exercises
- Bash scripts for Linux usage, automation, and system tasks
- Small, focused examples reflecting real Embedded Linux workflows
